# Sorting Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is it?

It provides a way of seeing how different types of sorting algorithms work.

## How to use it?

Click on any of the algorithms buttons to start the sorting!

### New array

You can generate new arrays of the same size as the one before.

### Change size and speed of array (Slider)

As its name says, just drag and move the slider to increase or decrease array size and speed of the animations.

### Sorting buttons

Just click on any of the sorting buttons to start the sorting animations! There is sorting algorithms by Merge, Selection, Bubble, Heap, Quick and Insertion.

## Learn More

Sorting algorithms are so important in computer science so I'd recommend learning more by slowing the animation speed and seeing how the algorithms actually do the job.
